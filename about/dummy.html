            <h4>About me? From a unprofessional introducer...</h4>
            Hey, this is Nijum. I am a tech enthusiast.
            I have done my undergrad in computer science and now working as a full stack software engineer.
            Along with computer science I love to explore electronics, make things from scratch and study about science.
            I am always open to discuss, learn and work on new projects and topics.
            I can assure you that I am your man as long as I enjoy the discussion and work.
            <h4>Maybe you are wondering why this site is so weird. design? broken/missing functionality or feature?</h4>
            Well, I am not a good designer.
            And as already mentioned, making things from scratch makes me thrilled.
            I don't want to use any server backend or static site generator for my Notebook.
            So, this site is made from some HTML, CSS and JS with minimal efforts in my free time.
            <h4>I am interested in...</h4>
            Many things.
            Let me create a quick list which i can think right now and update here.
            Before that you can always ask me.
            <div class="interest-words">

            </div>
            <h4>I am working now on...</h4>
            This list should be smaller than my interest list. I will add and update it here regularly.
            <div class="working-words">

            </div>
            <h4>If you ask "Are you available for some talk?"</h4>
            Sure. You can email me at "".
